# sprint-challenge
The sprintchallenge-basu.R code [ https://github.com/sanjaybasu/sprint-challenge/blob/master/sprintchallenge%20-%20basu.R ] develops a clinical decision score, which may help clinicians to identify patients most likely to experience greater benefits, and fewer risks, from undergoing intensive blood pressure treatment. The score was developed from SPRINT trial data, and tested using both SPRINT trial and ACCORD-BP trial data. 

An automated score calculator is available at: http://web.stanford.edu/~basus/sprint/
